# OpinionDigest

This repository contains the codebase of our paper [OpinionDigest A Simple Framework for Opinion Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01901) accepted at [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/).


OpinionDigest is an **unsupervised opinion summarization framework** that generates a summary from multiple review documents without requiring any gold-standard summary. 
OpinionDigest relies on an aspect-based sentiment classification model, which extracts opinions from input reviews, to train a seq2seq model that generates a summary from a set of opinions.
This framework enables the user to easily control the output by filtering input opinions using aspects and/or sentiment polarity.

Please see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01901) for details. Please also try our [online demo](http://extremereader.megagon.info/).  

This project is a collaboration with the Natural Language Processing Group at the University of Edinburgh ([EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/)).

## Installation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/megagonlabs/opiniondigest.git
$ cd opiniondigest
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

(Optional) To download data and pre-trained model files, run the command below.
```
$ ./download.sh
```

## Preprocessing

To run our framework, you need to preprocess your dataset and extract opinion phrases from the input sentences. You can use any ABSA models to perform the extraction task. 

For our experiment on [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) dataset, we used [this extractor (Snippext)](https://github.com/rit-git/Snippext_public) to extract opinions from the reviews.

Please follow [our example](example/yelp_extractions_example.jsonl) to format your extraction files.


## Running

The workflow has following 4 steps.
You can configure the settings of each step by creating JSON file. 

- Step 1. Data preparation
- Step 2. Training
- Step 3. Aggregation
- Step 4. Generation

You can skip Steps 1-3 by downloading our pre-trained model and dataset.


### Step 1. Data preparation

```
$ python src/prepare.py \
  config/prepare_{p_name}.json
```

The script will create training/development/test datasets.

```
$ ls data/{p_name}
train.csv
dev.csv
test.csv
```


### Step 2. Training

To train a model, run the following script with configurations files for preparation and training. 

```
$ python src/train.py \
  config/prepare_{p_name}.json \
  config/train_{t_name}.json
```

The training script saves following model files.

```
$ ls model
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}.model
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}_IN_TEXT.field
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}_OUT_TEXT.field
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}_ID.field
```

### Step 3. Aggregation

```
$ python src/aggregate.py \
  config/aggregate_{a_name}.json \
  config/prepare_{p_name}.json \
  config/train_{t_name}.json
```

The script generates following three files.

```
$ ls data/{p_name}
train_{a_name}.csv
dev_{a_name}.csv
test_{a_name}.csv
```

Here `p_name` needs to be specified in the configuration file `aggregate_{a_name}.json`.
`a_name` is generated from the parameters `_n_k_att_pol`:
- `n` is the number of reviews;
- `k` is the top-k frequent extractions;
- `att` is the attribute of the extractions;
- `pol` is the sentiment polarity of the extractions.


### Step 4. Generation

To generate summaries using OpinionDigest model, run the command below:    

```
$ python src/generate.py \
  config/prepare_{p_name}.json \
  config/train_{t_name}.json \
  config/aggregate_{a_name}.json \
  config/generate_{g_name}.json
```

This will creates following output and log files. 

```
$ ls output
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}_{g_name}.csv
{p_name}_op2text_{t_name}_{g_name}.log
```


### Evaluation

```
$ python src/evaluate.py \
  config/prepare_yelp-default.json \
  config/train_tiny.json \
  config/aggregate_default.json \
  config/generate_beam.json
```

```
$ cat output/default_op2text_default_greedy.eval
